# memes_final
Mains task: classify memes as misogynous or not misogynous.

In this project we will do task 5: Multimedia Automatic Misogyny Identification (MAMI), subtask A.

The purpose of this task is to identify if a meme should be considered misogynous or nor misogynous.

To be able to acces the data it is necessary to put all the files (training, test, trial) from the MAMI data set on a file in google drive named 'data_memes'.
